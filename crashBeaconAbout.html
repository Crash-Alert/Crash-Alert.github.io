<h1> What is Crash Beacon? </h1>
	<body> Crash Beacon utilizes the built-in accelerometer in android phones to detect when phones experience extreme forces such as those during a plane crash. When the force experienced by the phone exceeds a certain threshold, the Geolocation as well as an S.O.S. signal are sent to a server where response teams are able to track the trajectory of a plane as it is descending. Thereby, creating an accurate search area for the crashed plane. 

	<h3> Application to Real World Events </h3>
	<p> The team was inspired by recent world events such as the lost Mylasian Airlines Flight. They wanted to make a difference by helping the families of those involved in plane crashes get closure and possibly even save the lives of many loved ones.</p>
